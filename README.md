# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Come dive into e-commerce with me! 

This project aims to identify, understand, and share key patterns and insights of a simulated real-world online shopping platform from 2024. 

Through a series of [SQL queries](/Dashboard_Queries/), I analyzed categories such as Sales and Revenue, Shipments, Customer Performance, as well as Reviews and Ratings. The findings are summarized in a concise [OAC dashboard](/assets/Online_shop_2024.png) for a quick overview.
